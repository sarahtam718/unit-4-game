## What the project does

A random number is generated and the user must click on crystals to increase their score to match the random number. However, the user does not know the value of the crystal (randomly chosen) until the person clicks on that crystal. If a user's score is greater than the random number, then the user loses. If the user's score is the same as the random number, then the user wins.
